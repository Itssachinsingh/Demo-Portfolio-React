Questions:

1. 


we say we don't call function like '{lout()}' cause they will be triggered on the page loading and that is why we use '{()=> lout()}'  but we can write like {lout}...

IF the function is var lout= ()=>{
	your code here
} 


then We can write

 onClick={lout}

And

onClick={()=>lout()}


2. What is Props?
3. Props vs State data?
4.What is Hooks?
